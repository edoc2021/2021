Senior researchers will provide feedback and advice on the work and advice on managing research projects. The Doctoral Consortium is also a place to establish a social network with the peers in the field of the conference. In addition, there will be an opportunity to engage with some industry participants interested in this domain.<br/>\nThe technical scope of the Doctoral Consortium is that of EDOC 2021, as described by the list of the topics in the EDOC 2021 call for papers. This Conference series emphasizes a holistic view of enterprise applications engineering and management, fostering integrated approaches that can address and relate processes, people and technology. <br/>\nWe encourage submissions from Ph.D. students at an early stage of their research project, i.e., typically in their first or second year using a variety of research methodologies including engineering and empirical methodologies. A submission to the DC should clearly describe motivation, goal, expected results and the research approach taken. Participants will be expected to actively discuss and argue about their work by reading each other’s work prior to the Consortium, giving a presentation at the Consortium, debating together, and listening to senior researchers’ feedback.</p>\n<div style=\"font-size:18pt;\">Submission</div>\n<div style=\"margin-bottom: 2pt\">To submit a paper:</div>\n<ul>\n<li>Go to EasyChair: <a style=\"color: black;text-decoration: underline;\" href=\"https://easychair.org/\"><i>https://easychair.org</i></a><br/></li>\n<li>Login (if you already have an account) or Create an Account and then login</li>\n<li>Navigate to <a style=\"color: black;text-decoration: underline;\" href=\"https://easychair.org/my/conference?conf=edoc2021\"><i>https://easychair.org/my/conference?conf=edoc2021</i></a><br/></li>\n<li>Click <strong>make a new submission</strong></li>\n<li>Select <strong>EDOC2021 Doctoral Consortium</strong> and click <strong>Continue</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>To participate at the Doctoral Consortium, students should submit a paper (typically 4 to 6 pages) should cover the following aspects:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The context and goal of the research;</li>\n<li>The scientific problem addressed in the PhD project and its relevance to the conference field.

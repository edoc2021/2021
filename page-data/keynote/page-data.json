Roles included Software Architect and Software Development Engineer as well as Development Lead, Development Manager, and Group Software Engineering Manager. Today, he works as an Architect in the Big Data group; a group in Azure Data, the organization that ships all data services on Azure as well as the on-premises data products like SQL Server. He has led efforts to ship many products and services at Microsoft, from Power Query (an engine that ships as part of Excel and also powers many other products and services, incl. Power BI) to Azure Stream Analytics to Azure Data Lake Analytics and now, in an architect role, Azure Synapse Analytics. Some core themes permeating much of his work are centered around advanced language and system concepts, such as declarative/functional/dataflow languages and how they enable composable and massively scalable system implementations.</p>\n<p>From 1994 to 1999, Clemens served as Associate Professor in the School of Computer Science, QUT, Brisbane, Australia. In 1993, he co-founded Oberon microsystems, Inc., in Zurich, Switzerland. In 1992/1993, he held a Postdoc scholarship at the International Computer Science Institute at UC Berkeley, California. He authored the award-wining books Component Software (Addison-Wesley 1997 and 2002) and Software Ecosystem (MIT Press 2003) and holds a PhD in Computer Science (Dr. sc.-techn.) from ETH Zurich, Switzerland, and a Masters in Electrical Engineering (Dipl.-Ing.) from RWTH Aachen, Germany. Clemens also holds around 30 US patents, with more pending, and is the author or co-author of numerous publications. He’s served on steering and program committees for many conferences and has served on the national research funding review boards for four different countries.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Composing Cloud Services for Analytics and AI - oh my!","date":"2020/11/15","authors":"Clemens Szyperski"}}},{"node":{"id":"ca320290-07f1-5c93-8d1b-3990c907b745","html":"<img align=\"right\" width=\"185\" style=\"margin-left:16px;margin-right:16px\" src=\"https://researcher.watson.ibm.com/researcher/photos/541.jpg\">\n<p><strong>Dr. Heiko Ludwig</strong> is a Principal Research Staff Member and Senior Manager with IBM’s Almaden Research Center in San Jose, CA. Leading the AI Platforms research group, Heiko is currently working on topics related to computational platforms for AI, more specifically for machine learning, from Cloud to IOT. This includes federated machine learning and inference along with machine learning privacy and security. The results of this work contribute to various IBM lines of business.</p>\n<p>Throughout his career he was mostly dealing with issues of scaling systems, resilience and crossing organizational boundaries. These technically challenging topics evolve over time with the platforms we use and the applications we like to run on, from B2B applications on the early Internet to issues of mobile systems using the Cloud, to today’s (federated) machine learning frameworks and applications. How to build systems and services that scale? How to monitor, manage performance effectively. How to reach over organizational boundaries, e.g., connecting processes of different providers, in a robust and secure way? Other topics include computer supported collaborative work, workflow management, rule-based systems and machine learning.</p>\n<p>Heiko is an ACM Distinguished Engineer and published more than 100 refereed articles, conference papers, and book chapters as well as technical reports. He is a managing editor of the International Journal of Cooperative Information Systems. He is an associated editor of two other journals, and served on about 150 program committees of conferences and workshops in the field, co-organizing workshops and serving as PC Co-Chair and General Co-Chair on a number of conferences. He serves regularly on PhD and Tenure Committees of leading universities and gives lectures in master and PhD classes on numerous occasions. He also gave a number of keynote speeches at conferences and workshops in the field. Heiko served as a project reviewer of EU IST program and national research funding programs. He represented IBM in the OGF GRAAP working group, publishing the WS-Agreement standard.</p>\n<p>Prior to the Alamaden Research Center, Heiko held different positions at IBM in the TJ Watson Research Center, the Zurich Research Laboratory, and IBM’s South American Delivery Centers in Argentina and Brazil. He holds a Master’s (Diplom) degree and a PhD in information systems (Wirtschaftsinformatik) from Otto-Friedrich University Bamberg, Germany. </p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Federated Learning for the Enterprise - addressing organizational and regulatory boundaries for machine learning","date":"2020/09/20","authors":"Heiko Ludwig"}}},{"node":{"id":"be05a6cc-bfb7-540a-b032-84826e7c80ed","html":"<img align=\"right\" width=\"185\" style=\"margin-left:16px;margin-right:16px\" src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/edoc2021/2021/dev/static/img/Tamara.jpg\">\n<p><strong>Professor Tamara Davis</strong> is an astrophysicist who studies the elusive “dark energy” that’s accelerating the universe.

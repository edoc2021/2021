EDOC conferences address the full range of models, methodologies, and engineering technologies contributing to intra- and inter-enterprise software systems.</p>\n<p>Since 1997, EDOC has brought together leading computer scientists, software engineers, IT decision makers, enterprise architects, solution designers, and practitioners to discuss enterprise computing challenges, models and solutions from the perspectives of academia, industry, and government.</p>\n<p>The IEEE EDOC conference series emphasises a holistic view on enterprise applications engineering and management, fostering integrated approaches that relate business processes, people, software, and technology.</p>\n<p>Over the time new technologies emerged, e.g., service architectures, model-driven engineering, business process management, event-based processing and big data, each bringing new challenges and themes to EDOC conferences. The theme of EDOC’21 is considering enterprise computing challenges in the context of new technologies related to the fourth industrial revolution and beyond. The aim is to: (a) address new challenges in domains like healthcare, advanced manufacturing, environmental management, sustainable agriculture and FinTech, while ensuring compliance with human rights, ethics and legal challenges, long-term interoperability and supportability; (b) study how technologies such as digital twins, IoT, distributed ledgers/blockchain can be integrated in a systematic Enterprise Computing approach; (c) investigate how to combine data-driven approaches (including Machine Learning) with symbolic modelling approaches for Enterprise Computing. EDOC 2021 is to be held physically, planning to host both national and international audiences. We will also consider a hybrid option, as it may reflect COVID19 developments, such as national face to face attendees and virtual international participation. We will be monitoring the situation and will update this website accordingly.</p>\n<div style=\"font-size:18pt;\">Topics</div>\n<p>High-quality contributions addressing application domains, systems of systems life cycle, and implementation technologies used to build, deploy and operate enterprise computing systems.</p>\n<p><u>Enterprise and Systems Architecture</u></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Methods, Frameworks and Tools supporting Architecture<br/></li>\n<li>Reference Architectures, Architecture Conceptualisation &#x26; Evaluation<br/></li>\n<li>System architectures for digital twins<br/></li>\n<li>Interoperability and collaboration<br/></li>\n<li>Cloud computing and the evolution of enterprise architectures<br/></li>\n</ul>\n<p><u>Service-Oriented IT- and Enterprise Architectures</u><br/></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Service composition, orchestration and choreography<br/></li>\n<li>Quality of Service (QoS) and Cost of Service (CoS)<br/></li>\n<li>Governance in Service-oriented architectures (SOA/SOEA)<br/></li>\n<li>Service policies, contract definition and enforcement<br/></li>\n</ul>\n<p><u>Software Architecture &#x26; Engineering</u></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Software engineering methods for enterprise computing</li>\n<li>Software architecture modelling approaches</li>\n<li>Analysis and design techniques for non-functional requirements</li>\n<li>Architectures for cyber-physical systems</li>\n<li>Security in software intensive enterprise-systems</li>\n</ul>\n<p><u>Model Based Enterprise Engineering</u></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Model-driven architectures and software development</li>\n<li>Modelling based on domain specific languages (DSL)</li>\n<li>Domain specific reference models</li>\n<li>Approaches based on reference architectures</li>\n<li>Methodologies for the construction of digital twins</li>\n</ul>\n<p><u>Enterprise Security</u></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Sensing and Awareness</li>\n<li>Threat modelling, attack simulation, intrusion detection</li>\n<li>Access control &#x26; SOA security</li>\n<li>Blockchain and enterprise security</li>\n</ul>\n<p><u>Business Process and Business rules</u></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Process modelling, verification, configuration and implementation</li>\n<li>Process mining and business analytics</li>\n<li>Cloud impact on BPM, business processes in the cloud</li>\n<li>Business process agility and decision management</li>\n<li>Business rule languages and engines, process compliance</li>\n<li>Robotic process automation</li>\n</ul>\n<p><u>Semantics and Information Management</u></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Business object modelling methodologies and approaches</li>\n<li>Taxonomies, ontologies and business knowledge integration</li>\n<li>Enterprise ontologies</li>\n<li>Master data management, data mining and (real-time) data<br>\nwarehousing, data lakes</li>\n<li>Complex event processing and event-driven architectures</li>\n<li>Data quality and trustworthiness</li>\n<li>Combining data-driven and symbolic modelling approaches</li>\n</ul>\n<div style=\"font-size:18pt;margin-bottom: 8pt\">Submission Guidelines</div>\n<div style=\"margin-bottom: 2pt\">To submit a paper:</div>\n<ul>\n<li>Go to EasyChair: <a style=\"color: black;text-decoration: underline;\" href=\"https://easychair.org/\"><i>https://easychair.org</i></a><br/></li>\n<li>Login (if you already have an account) or Create an Account and then login</li>\n<li>Navigate to <a style=\"color: black;text-decoration: underline;\" href=\"https://easychair.org/my/conference?conf=edoc2021\"><i>https://easychair.org/my/conference?conf=edoc2021</i></a><br/></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Two types of submissions are solicited:<br/>\n    a) scientific research papers, and <br/>\n    b) industry experience reports or case studies. <br/></p>\n<p>Scientific papers should describe original results, and not been accepted or submitted for publication elsewhere.

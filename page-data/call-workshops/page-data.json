Since 1997, EDOC conferences address the full range of models,\nmethodologies, and engineering technologies contributing to intra- and\ninter-enterprise application systems. </p>\n<p>The main conference is accompanied with a number of workshops prior to the main event. They provide an excellent forum for smaller groups of industry experts, researchers, consumers and other interested parties, to discuss specific topics of interest, in a less formal structure than the main conference. The ultimate goal is to develop common understanding of the challenges, possible solutions and stimulate longer term collaboration of participants. These workshops can focus on the established technologies in new application areas, or even new areas of inquiries, some of which are listed next.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Enterprise Architecture</li>\n<li>Interoperability, Federation and Integration</li>\n<li>Service-Oriented Architectures</li>\n<li>Software Architecture and Engineering</li>\n<li>Model-Driven Engineering</li>\n<li>Digital Twins </li>\n<li>Enterprise security, information privacy and consent</li>\n<li>Distributed Ledgers and Smart Contracts</li>\n<li>Business Process and Business rules</li>\n<li>Advanced analytics and AI for business and consumer applications</li>\n<li>Semantics and Information Management</li>\n<li>Digital Ethics, Law and Human Rights</li>\n<li>Community trust, resilience, and responsibility - AI concerns</li>\n<li>Human Machine Ecology - Challenges and Opportunities</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The theme of EDOC 2021 is <strong>Industry 4.0</strong> â€“ a very exciting and active research field.\nWe invite you to submit proposals for one-day or half-day workshops, physical or virtual, focusing on\nthese topics as well as emerging and interdisciplinary topics related to\nenterprise computing in general, or in domains such as healthcare,\nadvanced manufacturing, environmental sciences, sustainable agriculture,\nfinance, transportation, Aerospace and Defence, energy and supply chains, while ensuring compliance\nwith the related human rights, ethics and legal challenges and longer-term\ninteroperability strategies. Both research and application-oriented\ntopics are welcome. </p>\n<p>The EDOC workshops are intended to animate a lively discussion of innovative\nideas, recent progress, or practical approaches and applications. Each workshop will\nprovide a collaborative forum for a group of typically 15 to 30 participants to\nexchange recent and/or preliminary results, to conduct intensive discussions on a\nparticular topic, or to coordinate efforts between representatives of a technical\ncommunity.</p>\n<p>We encourage workshops organizers to propose various workshop\nformat and be creative when structuring their workshop programs and CfPs.</p>\n<p>Next to\npaper presentations, workshops can be also enriched by invited practitioners or\nresearch talks, by discussion and working groups as well as demonstrations etc.\nRelated idea/vision or short papers do not have to be included in the IEEE workshop\nproceedings. Workshops organizers will have the chance to select the type of\nproceedings (e.g. IEEE, post-proceedings, etc.) based on the types of contributions. </p>\n<div style=\"font-size:18pt;\">Important Dates</div>\n<ul>\n<li>Paper submission deadline:  16 August 2021</li>\n<li>Notification of acceptance:  13 September 2021</li>\n<li>Camera ready paper:  27 September 2021</li>\n<li>Conference registration: 27 September 2021</li>\n</ul>\n<div style=\"font-size:18pt;\">Workshop Proposal Guidelines</div>\nYour proposal document must contain the following information:\n<ol>\n<li>Title of the workshop</li>\n<li>Proposed duration of the workshop (full-day or half-day)</li>\n<li>Name, affiliation, and e-mail addresses of the workshop chairs</li>\n<li>Extended abstract (500-1000 words) explaining the workshop topics and their fit\nwith the EDOC conference, intended audience, organization/format of the\nworkshop: Specify the type of contributions, distribution into sessions, type of\nsessions you intend to solicit and other relevant details.</li>\n<li>\n<p>Preliminary Call for Papers, including:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Workshop description, background and goals;</li>\n<li>List of topics</li>\n<li>Preliminary list of program committee members</li>\n<li>Information about distribution channels (e.g., mailing lists, web-site, direct mailings\nto past presenters, other direct mailings) that will be used for advertising the\nworkshop</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>History of the workshop (if it was held before) with some statistics</li>\n<li>Short biographies of workshop chairs.</li>\n</ol>\n<div style=\"font-size:18pt;\">Submissions</div>\n<p>Please ensure that you adhere to the above workshop proposal guidelines providing\nall requested information using at most six pages.

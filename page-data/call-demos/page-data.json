Prototypes and applications may originate either from research projects or from industry. Proposals for demonstrations should focus on innovative concepts or technologies that address models, methodologies, and engineering technologies contributing to intra- and inter-enterprise application systems. Authors of accepted conference papers are also invited to propose demonstrations of their work.</p>\n<div style=\"font-size:18pt;\">Topics of Interest</div>\n<p>Areas of interest for demonstrations include all topics of the IEEE EDOC conference. Specific topics of interest include but are not limited to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Enterprise Architecture (EA) and Enterprise Service Architecture (ESA)</li>\n<li>Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA)</li>\n<li>Business Process Management (BPM) and Business Rules</li>\n<li>Process Mining</li>\n<li>Business Intelligence and Business Analytics</li>\n<li>Big Data &#x26; Data Mining</li>\n<li>Information Integration and Interoperability</li>\n<li>Model-based Approaches</li>\n<li>Enterprise Applications Deployment and Governance</li>\n<li>Security Solutions for Enterprises</li>\n<li>Internet of Things (IIoT)</li>\n<li>Digital Twins</li>\n<li>Advanced Manufacturing</li>\n</ul>\n<div style=\"font-size:18pt;\">Submission Guidelines and Review Process</div>\n<div style=\"margin-bottom: 2pt\">To submit a paper:</div>\n<ul>\n<li>Go to EasyChair: <a style=\"color: black;text-decoration: underline;\" href=\"https://easychair.org/\"><i>https://easychair.org</i></a><br/></li>\n<li>Login (if you already have an account) or Create an Account and then login</li>\n<li>Navigate to <a style=\"color: black;text-decoration: underline;\" href=\"https://easychair.org/my/conference?conf=edoc2021\"><i>https://easychair.org/my/conference?conf=edoc2021</i></a><br/></li>\n<li>Click <strong>make a new submission</strong></li>\n<li>Select <strong>EDOC2021 Demo Track</strong> and click <strong>Continue</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Demonstration paper submissions are invited for potential inclusion in the demonstration track. All submissions must be made in PDF format and comply with the <a style=\"color: black;text-decoration: underline;\" href=\"https://www.ieee.org/conferences_events/conferences/publishing/templates.html\"><i>IEEE Computer Society Conference Proceedings Format Guidelines</i></a>. Demonstration papers should address the aforementioned topics in no more than 4 pages, which should include the following information:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Title and authors</li>\n<li>Abstract: A brief description of the prototype or application, together with a statement on how conference participants benefit from attending the demonstration</li>\n<li>System overview</li>\n<li>Summary of innovative concepts and significance for the EDOC domain as well as functions or features to be demonstrated. If applicable, include brief descriptions of case studies performed using the prototype or application, provide scalability data or pointers indicating where readers can find more information about these case studies.</li>\n<li>Link (optional): A link to a Web page where to download or use the tool.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Additionally, authors will be requested to provide a link to a short online video or screencast not exceeding 6 minutes in length (hard limit) of their demonstration. The video must be playable using a wide variety of media players.</p>\n<p>The demo paper should be submitted electronically through the EDOC 2021 submission system (<a href=\"https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=edoc2021\">https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=edoc2021</a>)  selecting the “make a new submission” option, which will take you directly to the Demo Track, as main conference submissions are now closed.</p>\n<p>The demonstration chairs and demo committee will review all submissions. Accepted demonstration papers are published in the workshop proceedings of the EDOC conference, which will be submitted to the Xplore® digital library. At least one presenter of each accepted demonstration must register for the conference and be in attendance to present the demonstration.</p>\n<p>A best demo award will be given to the author(s) of the highest-scoring demo based on technical merit.</p>\n<div style=\"font-size:18pt;\">Demonstration Track Chairs</div>\n<p>Chiara Di Francescomarino, Fondazione Bruno Kessler, Trento, Italy (dfmchiara@fbk.eu)<br/>\nKarolin Winter, University of Vienna, Austria (karolin.winter@univie.ac.at)<br/>\nKeith Duddy, S23M, Brisbane, Australia (keith.duddy@s23m.com)</p>\n<div style=\"font-size:18pt;\">Important Dates</div>\n<ul>\n<li>Paper submission deadline:  <del>16 August 2021</del> <span style=\"color:#f63a3a\"><strong>Extended to 20 August 2021</strong></span></li>\n<li>Notification of acceptance:  13 September 2021</li>\n<li>Camera ready paper:  27 September 2021</li>\n<li>Conference registration: 27 September 2021</li>\n</ul>"}},"pageContext":{}},"staticQueryHashes":["26522286","810778402"]}

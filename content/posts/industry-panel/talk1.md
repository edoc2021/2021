There is a growing interest in industry and government on mitigating the drain on productivity due to poor data quality
and data access issues and improving trust in analytical results from unexplainable data pipelines. These challenges cut
across technical (e.g. data curation at scale), social (e.g. dealing with data bias) and business (e.g. value creation
from data) issues.

In collaboration with the <a style="color: black;text-decoration: underline;" href="/"><i>25th International Conference
on Enterprise Computing EDOC2021</i></a>,
the <a style="color: black;text-decoration: underline;" href="https://cires.org.au/"><i>ARC Training Centre for
Information Resilience</i></a> presents a panel discussion on perspectives and conflicting priorities of Information
Resilience, which we define as the “capacity of organizations to create, protect and sustain agile data pipelines,
capable of detecting and responding to failures and risks across the information value chain in which the data is
sourced, shared, transformed, analysed and consumed.”

Each panel member will present their position statement to shed light on the challenges and highlight recent advances in
the field. The presentations will be followed by a Q&A session with the audience.

IEEE EDOC'21 is the twenty-fifth conference in a series that provides the key forum for researchers and practitioners in the field of enterprise computing. EDOC conferences address the full range of models, methodologies, and engineering technologies contributing to intra- and inter-enterprise software systems.

Since 1997, EDOC has brought together leading computer scientists, software engineers, IT decision makers, enterprise architects, solution designers, and practitioners to discuss enterprise computing challenges, models and solutions from the perspectives of academia, industry, and government.

The IEEE EDOC conference series emphasises a holistic view on enterprise applications engineering and management, fostering integrated approaches that relate business processes, people, software, and technology.

Over the time new technologies emerged, e.g., service architectures, model-driven engineering, business process management, event-based processing and big data, each bringing new challenges and themes to EDOC conferences. The theme of EDOC'21 is considering enterprise computing challenges in the context of new technologies related to the fourth industrial revolution and beyond. The aim is to: (a) address new challenges in domains like healthcare, advanced manufacturing, environmental management, sustainable agriculture and FinTech, while ensuring compliance with human rights, ethics and legal challenges, long-term interoperability and supportability; (b) study how technologies such as digital twins, IoT, distributed ledgers/blockchain can be integrated in a systematic Enterprise Computing approach; (c) investigate how to combine data-driven approaches (including Machine Learning) with symbolic modelling approaches for Enterprise Computing. EDOC 2021 is to be held physically, planning to host both national and international audiences. We will also consider a hybrid option, as it may reflect COVID19 developments, such as national face to face attendees and virtual international participation. We will be monitoring the situation and will update this website accordingly.

<div style="margin-bottom: 2pt">To submit a paper:</div>

- Go to EasyChair: <a style="color: black;text-decoration: underline;" href="https://easychair.org/"><i>https://easychair.org</i></a><br/>
- Login (if you already have an account) or Create an Account and then login
- Navigate to <a style="color: black;text-decoration: underline;" href="https://easychair.org/my/conference?conf=edoc2021"><i>https://easychair.org/my/conference?conf=edoc2021</i></a><br/>

Two types of submissions are solicited:<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a) scientific research papers, and <br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;b) industry experience reports or case studies. <br/>

Scientific papers should describe original results, and not been accepted or submitted for publication elsewhere. These papers will be peer reviewed based on their scientific and technical contribution, originality, and relevance.

Industry experience reports should provide insights into applying enterprise computing technology in practice, feedback about the state of practice, and/or pose challenges for researchers. These reports must be based on actual implementation and have at least one author with industry affiliation. These papers will be evaluated based on appropriateness, significance, and clarity. 

Full papers should follow the IEEE Proceedings Formatting Guidelines (8-10 pages) and be submitted in PDF format.

All papers will be refereed by at least 3 members of the international programme committee. The Proceedings will be published by the IEEE Computer Society Press and be available through IEEE Xplore and the IEEE Digital Library.

Each paper must have one of its authors registered to EDOC'21 before the camera ready deadline. The organisers reserve the right to remove a paper from the proceedings if no author is registered by the camera ready deadline. Only papers presented during the conference will be published in the Proceedings.

<div style="font-size:18pt;">Post Conference Publication</div>

The authors of selected papers will be invited to prepare a substantially revised and extended version to a Special Issue on Enterprise Computing in a top journal (traditionally Elsevier <i>Information Systems)</i>.

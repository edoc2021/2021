<div style="font-size:16pt;font-weight: bold;margin-bottom: 10pt">1. AI for Health: Closing the Loop from Research to Applications</div>

Organisations and industries of all disciplines are reaping the benefits of artificial intelligence and machine learning techniques to improve their decision-making process. The health industry, in particular, being a data-intensive field, has a lot of AI applications such as analysing Gene sequencing data or medical images for diagnostic decision making, analysing electronic health records for improving patient treatment process, and recommendation of personalised treatments based on heterogeneous data. Multitude of machine learning, and data mining methods are applied in this domain from statistics, regression and clustering to neural networks, and network science.
Healthcare data present a unique set of challenges, including high dimensionality, class imbalance, low numbers of samples, and limited interpretability. Healthcare data are captured in different formats, including numeric, textual reports, signals and images, and sourced from different systems and providers. Integrating and analysing such complex dataset to deliver a meaningful outcome to the end-user in a challenging task that requires a sound understanding of the domain knowledge coming from ontologies, annotation repositories, and domain experts. This requires close collaboration between researchers and end-users of AI applications. Moreover, trust and interpretability are crucial when bringing the research outcomes into practice.
This workshop aims to bring AI researchers and health industry domain experts together to present and discuss the latest research in AI for health, and the challenges and opportunities in translating AI research to shape the future of healthcare applications. It will attract healthcare practitioners who have access to interesting data sources and looking for expertise and methodologies to leverage AI techniques effectively. Special attention will be devoted to building end-user trust through interpretability and transparency of AI, ethics and novel technologies such as blockchain.

<div style="font-size:16pt;font-weight: bold;margin-bottom: 10pt">3. International Workshop on Data Leakage Protection (DLP) and Trustworthiness in Health Data</div>

Data leakage is the accidental or intended unauthorized transmission of data from an organization to unintended recipients. Data leakage threats can originate internally or externally via email, web, mobile data storage devices such as USB drives and laptops. Data leakage protection (DLP) is an approach to detect data leakage and/or ensure end-users do not send confidential or sensitive information outside of the enterprise network. These strategies may involve a combination of user and security policies and security monitoring, detection, and prevention tools. This DLP track of this workshop focuses on DLP response mechanisms to detect data leakage, protect and prevent data in all its shapes, such as text, images within an organization, on the cloud, or edge, from the risk of getting leaked accidentally or intentionally. Moreover, requirements for future healthcare data management are likely to include increased volume and diversity, shared between an increasingly diverse range of people (e.g. practitioners, specialists, patients) and organizations (e.g. healthcare providers, technology providers, and social services). Regardless of the architecture used, a key enabler of interoperability is clarification of “trust”. The Trustworthiness in health data track of this workshop will explore key aspects of trust, relevant trust-based concepts, and suitable semantic repository technologies capable of supporting a federated, community-oriented approach.

<div style="font-size:16pt;font-weight: bold;margin-bottom: 10pt">5. Intelligent Digital Architecture, Methods, and Services for Industry 4.0 and Society 5.0</div>

The digital transformation of global industries and value chains and the associated need for a structured research and standardization has given rise to major global and national initiatives. These initiatives address potentials and challenges of digitalization. Enterprises and societies currently face crucial challenges, while Industry 4.0 becomes important in the global manufacturing industry all the more. Industry 4.0 offers a range of opportunities for companies to increase the flexibility and efficiency of production processes. The development of new business models can be promoted with digital platforms and architectures for Industry 4.0. Industry 4.0 is dedicated to research and practice for industry and supports the implementation of this vision, especially in manufacturing companies. According to Japanese government, Society 5.0 is more general and can be defined as fusion between cyberspace and physical space, addressing economic progress aligned with solving social problems by providing goods and services to meet repeated latent needs regardless of location, age, gender, or language.

The EDOC Workshop – Intelligent Digital Architecture, Methods, and Services for Industry 4.0 and Society 5.0 – covers fundamental and practical aspects to support the digital transformation. This disruptive change interacts with all information processes and systems, which are important business enablers for the digital transformation since years. Intelligent digital architectures enable the intense interaction with customers and products. The customer is closely integrated with business processes and interacts like a co-worker by using implicit touch points, which are provided by mobility and wearable systems and the Internet of Things. In this way customer experience is fostered with disruptive transformation and continuous improvement. 

We are delighted to invite contributions to the EDOC Workshop – Intelligent Digital Architecture, Methods, and Services for Industry 4.0 and Society 5.0. Our aim is to provide a platform for researchers and practitioners to discuss both technological and business aspects in the context of digital architectures, methods, processes, services, products, platforms and business models. We also investigate how intelligent digital architectures support new ways of value co-creation for Industry 4.0 and Society 5.0.

<div style="font-size:16pt;font-weight: bold;margin-bottom: 10pt">6. Digital Twins for Industry 4.0 Solutions – an Australian Perspective</div>

Leading analyst firms are reporting the widespread adoption of Digital Twins and some describe it as the “proliferation” of this emerging technology approach in a broad range of industries, market, and even governments.

Digital Twins are a software pattern that represent a physical entity or object. The Digital Twin Consortium (DTC) defines a Digital Twins as a virtual representation of real-world entities and processes, synchronized at a specified frequency and fidelity.
- Digital twin systems transform business by accelerating holistic understanding, optimal decision-making, and effective action.
- Digital twins use real-time and historical data to represent the past and present and simulate predicted futures.
- Digital twins are motivated by outcomes, tailored to use cases, powered by integration, built on data, guided by domain knowledge, and implemented in Information Technology/Operational Technology (IT/OT) systems.

With as much as 85% of industrial organizations indicating that they have already started in some shape or form, it is an emerging technology that will have a significant impact on enterprise computing requirements now and in the future.

<div style="font-size:16pt;font-weight: bold;margin-bottom: 10pt">7. First International Workshop on Latest Advances in Enterprise Architectures in the IoT Era (EAIoT'2021)</div>

Internet of Things (IoT), one of the fastest growing Information and Communication Technologies (ICT), is impacting organizations from all perspectives (e.g., operational, legal, financial, and competitiveness) forcing them to review their functional and non-functional practices. According to the International Data Corporation (IDC), ``IoT spending will increase by a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 13.6% from 2017 to 2022, reaching $1.2 trillion within the next four years. It is also predicted 41 billion IoT devices by 2027 and 70% of automobiles will be connected to the Internet by 2023.

To tap into the endless benefits and uses of IoT, the design principles and foundations of organizations' enterprise architectures are expected to adjust to ensure a smooth integration of IoT into these architectures’ foundations namely organization, business, information, application, and technology. Aiming at examining these foundations separately and then collectively, this workshop is an open forum for discussions between academics and industry partners about the latest advances and developments in the dynamic field of enterprise architecture in the IoT era. The workshop addresses the lack of techniques and guidelines that would enable enterprises to integrate IoT into the life cycle of designing, developing, and deploying enterprise architectures. This integration should lead to a new generation of enterprise architectures that would foster not only a deeper retrospect on the involved interactive digital resources inside the life cycle covering data collection, information analysis, knowledge reasoning and wisdom strategies, but also a better understanding of potential threats as well as the development of new ways of aligning business and ICT resources together to improve the competitiveness of the enterprise in the background of the Artificial Intelligence (AI) trend.

Whilst, on the one hand, IoT enacts many opportunities that enterprises could tap into, there are also obstacles that could undermine these opportunities, on the other hand. Some of these obstacles are lack of standards that cover both enterprise architecture and IoT, security holes that potentially exist in IoT devices making them questionable in terms of trust, security, and privacy, IoT limitations like silo restriction, computational capabilities, lack of semantic technologies that should describe IoT in a machine-understandable manner, just to mention some.

<div style="font-size:16pt;font-weight: bold;margin-bottom: 10pt">8. Second International Workshop on Privacy and Security in Enterprise Modeling (PriSEM'21)</div>

Security and privacy are critical issues in modern organizations. Enterprise business processes and their supporting systems have to constantly evolve in order to comply with security and privacy policies. Complex organizational structures and their distributed business processes make such compliance a major effort. Moreover, the intersection between privacy and security technologies and software engineering has tremendous implications on the very way information systems are modeled for their design and development. These changes affect the requirements and software engineering processes in organizations. That is why security and privacy requirements have to be explicitly addressed in enterprise models while technologies supporting security and privacy have to become an integrated part of Enterprise Architecture.

Emerging technologies such as distributed ledgers, privacy-enhancing technologies, and blockchains leverage powerful cryptography features, all-purpose Turing-complete programming languages and flexible communication models. They are considered as new transparency security and privacy enablers for distributed processing without requiring a trusted third-party. Today, their integration within information systems is a difficult task for enterprise architects due to the paradigm-shifting nature of those technologies and the lack of adequate models and tools from the enterprise modeling community.

This paradigmatic shift can also be explained with privacy-enhancing technologies coming from a tradition of privacy as confidentiality. This area is under explored and yet to be understood. The goal of PriSEM’21 is to bring together researchers and practitioners to discuss theoretical and practical problems and solutions in a rapidly maturing domain of enterprise security and privacy. The integration of security and privacy aspects in enterprise models is a central theme of this workshop.

<div style="font-size:16pt;font-weight: bold;margin-bottom: 10pt">9. Privacy in the Modern World (PMW2021)</div>

In recent times, privacy is facing new previously unseen challenges, as demand for quality personal data is greater than ever before. For example, due to covid-19 pandemic, huge volumes of personal data are continuously collected worldwide, raising privacy concerns in general public. In healthcare and financial sectors, situation is similar, as large volumes of personal data are needed for research and day-to-day operations. Other industries and areas of life are facing similar challenges.

Legal frameworks are constantly changing to address privacy issues, making it difficult for the industry to keep up. Without a clear understanding of what their legal obligations are and what they can and cannot do with their business data, industry might not always be able to identify the challenges they are facing in the privacy arena and make the best use of their data.

Although various privacy protection techniques and solutions exist in the academic world, there is a lack of trained privacy specialists in the industry domain. What is missing is the collaboration platforms where industry can clarify their legal obligations, express their needs and work together with academia to find solutions that would allow them to exploit their business data while at the same time fulfilling privacy requirements.

One of the goals of this workshop is to bridge the gap between academia and industry by initiating International Privacy Network (IPN) as a platform for sharing information, exchanging ideas and fostering collaboration between academic, government and industry stakeholders. The IPN will be instigated through dissemination of scientific research papers, industry white papers and case studies, in the form of presentations and publications. In addition, social events will be organized to facilitate the launch of IPN.

<div style="font-size:16pt;font-weight: bold;margin-bottom: 10pt">10. International Workshop on Semantic Interoperability of Sensitive Data in Federated AI (SISFAI)</div>

In the Industry 4.0 era, digital enterprises generate and use vast amounts of data that are captured and stored at different locations to improve their business models by leveraging Artificial Intelligence (AI). AI systems that rely on central data processing are not suitable in most applications since central data processing leads to issues on data accessibility, standardization, privacy, and trustworthiness. Furthermore, semantic interoperability plays a fundamental role in applications where data have become increasingly diverse and complex. AI systems may have biased or even potentially dangerous results if the meaning of data is not well understood.

This workshop aims to address the semantic interoperability of federated data integration approaches for advanced analytics provided by AI applications that rely on different conditions for data accessibility. These approaches may include AI concerns on privacy, trust, resilience, digital ethics, law, and human rights and should follow the FAIR principles to foster not only higher levels of semantic interoperability but also findability, accessibility, and reusability.

<div style="font-size:16pt;font-weight: bold;margin-bottom: 10pt">11. The 13th Workshop on Service oriented Enterprise Architecture for Enterprise Engineering (SoEA4)</div>

Enterprise Engineering (EE) is the application of engineering principles to the design of Enterprise Architectures. It enables deriving the Enterprise Architecture from the enterprise goals and strategy and aligning it with the enterprise resources that also may be in the cloud or on the edge. Enterprise architecture is used to map the enterprise goal and strategy to the enterprise’s resources (actors, assets, IT supports) and to support the evolution of this mapping. It also provides documentation on the assignment of enterprise resources to the enterprise goals and strategy, e.g. for establishing new business models such as platforms. There are different paradigms for creating enterprise architecture. The most important is to encapsulate the functionalities of IT resources as services. By this means, it is possible to clearly describe the contributions of IT both in terms of functionality and quality and to define a service-oriented enterprise architecture (SoEA).

The goal of the workshop is to develop concepts and methods to assist the engineering and the management of service-oriented enterprise architectures (SoEA) and the software systems supporting them.

<div style="font-size:16pt;font-weight: bold;margin-bottom: 10pt">12. 1st Workshop on Secure Enterprise Architecture Design (SEAD)</div>

Traditional and isolated approaches to enterprise architecture, security and privacy often fall short. The 1st International Workshop focuses on secure enterprise architecture design (SEAD).  This workshop aims at providing a forum to government and industry who are interested in human-centric, performance outcome, risk-driven, data-driven and ecosystem-oriented approaches that are required to design the secure and adaptive enterprises. 

SEAD 2021 seeks experience reports, case studies and empirical research presentations including hands-on practical exercises or sessions that discuss the application of Enterprise Architecture and Security by Design practices in the real context. This provides opportunities to professionals and thought leaders to share, network and learn from each other through the presentation of industry success and failure cases. Government and Industry Practice Workshop will provide important insights into future directions and share practices which worked and which did not work including lessons learned, benefit realisation and limitations of SEAD practices. Government and industry submissions should be based on actual practice, and should cover all sides of the story - strengths and weaknesses, successes and challenges relevant to Enterprise Architecture and Security by Design practices.

<div style="font-size:16pt;font-weight: bold;margin-bottom: 10pt">13. 1st Workshop on Trust, Ethics and Compliance in Enterprise Computing (TrECEC)</div>

Computer Science and Legal Systems tend to live at opposite ends of the spectrum: the raisond'etre of digitalization initiatives is that of optimization: render decision processes faster, predictable, and resource efficient. Legal and ethical considerations aim for such systems to behave in a fair, trustworthy and non-discriminatory manner. While both Computer Science and Law are grounded in formal languages, there is a distance between what each field considers "formal". It is only a small number of lawyers that can interpret computer process and systems designs, and at the same time, programmers are not generally trained in testing their solutions against legal and ethical considerations. This is aggravated with the advent of AI in public and private sectors. Many prediction models are trained on historical data, that contains biases including race, gender or geographical location. These models may end up affecting the lives of citizens, with big infringement fines for companies and unfair treatment for those subjected to the technology. Companies aware of the ethical risks may simply avoid the application of some AI systems, and lose the opportunity to benefit from their potential.

The goal of this workshop is to create a dialogue involving academic and industrial fields between computer science and ethics/legal specialists. In particular, we aim to create a discussion space where novel research across computer science, logic, linguistics, law and ethics contribute to integrating regulatory and ethical considerations, and the processes of technology development including the software development lifecycle. Each session will be designed to include both legal systems and computer science perspectives with a focus on created understanding. Central themes are 1. law-code isomorphism: does such a thing exist? 2. Maintaining and conveying meaning between Technology and Law in software development. 3.Is there an objective measure for assessing legal and ethical compliance in software? 4. What human rights and other harms arise when technology and law are poorly aligned. Contributions to this theme range from theories of law and technology, and theoretical aspects on logics and semantics of programming languages and compliance verification, to real case studies and dilemmas with conflicting legal and ethical guidelines.

The VORTE series of workshops is devoted to the topics of vocabularies, ontologies and rules in the context of enterprise systems. Examples of topics covered by VORTE include the development and adaptation of foundational, business and domain ontologies for the enterprise, the use of ontologies and rules in all aspects of enterprise modeling such as business process management and services, the enhancement of rules and services with formal semantics, and the evaluation of such systems and approaches.

From the enterprise system development perspective, research topics are focused on relations of process modeling and execution languages with business ontologies and rules, and on how business ontologies and rules used in enterprise models are further propagated into technologies (e.g., linked data and semantic web) and architectures (e.g., service-oriented architectures) that enable collaboration between heterogeneous enterprise systems.

The workshop also welcomes experience reports and empirical studies that are reporting on the use of ontologies and rules in the enterprise system development life-cycle.

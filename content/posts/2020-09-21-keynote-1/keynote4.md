Professor Tamara Davis is an astrophysicist who studies the elusive “dark energy” that’s accelerating the universe.  She’s measured time-dilation in distant supernovae, helped make one of the largest maps of the distribution of galaxies in the universe, and is now measuring how supermassive black holes have grown over the last 12 billion years.  She led the Dark Theme within the Australian Research Council Centre of Excellence for All-sky Astrophysics, and is now helping manage international cosmology projects involving hundreds of researchers around the globe.

Her accolades include the Astronomical Society of Australia’s Ellery Lectureship for outstanding contributions to astronomy, the Australian Academy of Science’s Nancy Millis Medal for outstanding female leadership in science, and she is a Member of the Order of Australia.  She is passionate about science communication and you may recognise her as an occasional host of the ABC Science TV Show Catalyst.
